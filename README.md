# Satower defense

This project is an awfull very ugly designed game built in less than three weeks. But it works... (who know how ?)
10 years old after, I cannot imagin why I thought this was a great piece of code :-D
I put it on my github just not to loose it.

- Design is ugly
- Naming convention is strange
- Reading the code after years 
- The makefile ...

But:

- Allmost all can be configured :
  - The user interface
  - The maps
  - The monsters, thanks to the ogol micro langage
  - The towers
